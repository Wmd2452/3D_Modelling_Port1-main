Beginning Pagoda Modelling in Blender


Screenshot 1 - added three cubes to represent the base of the pagoda, the main tower that will extend upwards and the stairs leading up to it and then used scaleing and moved some vertices to change their size and shape slightly

Screenshot 2 - Added an additional rectangle and inset the top of the rectangle where i will create the roof of the pagoda.

Screenshot 3 Added additional geometry with loop cut (Swift loop) and then used the move tool to create a basic jagged riif structure

Screenshot 4 - Added edge creases to the border of the roof (purple highlights) to stop them from being smoothed later on when adding a subdivision (turbosmooth) modifier

Screenshot 5 - Added a Subdivision modifier to smooth the curvature of the roof
