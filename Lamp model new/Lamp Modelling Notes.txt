Screenshot 1 - Beginning of modelling a japanese temple lamp starting with a cube as tge beginning of the build

Screenshot 2 - Added Edit Poly and Symmetry modifier to evenly form the shape of the cube to my desired result

Screenshot 3 - Used Inset and extrude to place an indent in the cube for where the lamp windows will be

Screenshot 4 - Added four more elongated cubes to surround the base of the lamp

Screenshot 5 - Added a flat cube to sit the lamp and base on top of

Screenshot 6 - Added a long box for the roof and changed the pivot point to centre and duplicate by using the shift key copy to duplicate and rotate the box down the modified 
axis to create a roof slope

Screenshot 7 - shaped the box using edit poly to pull the vertices down and fill the gap and remove protrusions from the roof

Screenshot 8 - Adjusted Curvature of roof using the swift loop and move tool  made roof slightly larger with scale tools and added some additional rectangles as adornments

Screenshot 9 - Added a Turbo smooth modifier to smooth geometry on the roof

Switched to Blender

Screenshot 9 - Added a rectangle and used loop cut (swift loop) to add more edged then used the bevel tool (chamfer) to smooth out the deges to create the edge pattern

Screenshot 10 - Shrunk The size of the edited rectangle and added a mirror modifier to duplicate the geometry on all four corners of the center pillar to create a stand for the lamp base

Screenshot 11 - Used the join operation to join the two halves of the roof into one object

Screenshot 12 - Added a cuve created more geometry on said cube using loop cut tool (line loop) to add geometry then used the move tool create an ornament that hangs from the roof

Screenshot 13 - Used bevel edges (Chamfer) to smooth hard edges and used a mirror modifier to mirror a version of the object on the opposite side of the roof

Screenshot 14  and 15 - Deleting Hidden faces to save on ploy count and increase rendering efficiency

Screenshot 16 - Used Shrink / Flatten tool to fatten the base of the pole so that it tapers into a larger cylinder as it goes further down Then added a cube at the bottom deleted bottom face as it wouldnt ever be seen and joined both the rectangle base and the fattened suppourt pole

TRY THESE
NOTE -- USE A SPLINE TO DRAW ROOF SHAPE AND FORM THE CURRECT CURVE USE DRAWING TABLET TO DO SO PLUS REFERENCE IMAGE

NOTE __ USE SWIFT LOOP AND TURBO SMOOTH TO MAKE THE ROOF CURVATURE IANS SUGGESTION
