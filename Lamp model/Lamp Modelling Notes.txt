Screenshot 1 - Beginning of modelling a japanese temple lamp starting with a cube as tge beginning of the build

Screenshot 2 - Added Edit Poly and Symmetry modifier to evenly form the shape of the cube to my desired result

Screenshot 3 - Used Inset and extrude to place an indent in the cube for where the lamp windows will be

Screenshot 4 - Added four more elongated cubes to surround the base of the lamp

Screenshot 5 - Added a flat cube to sit the lamp and base on top of

Screenshot 6 - Added a long box for the roof and changed the pivot point to centre and duplicate by using the shift key copy to duplicate and rotate the box down the modified 
axis to create a roof slope

Screenshot 7 - shaped the box using edit poly to pull the vertices down and fill the gap and remove protrusions from the roof


TRY THESE
NOTE -- USE A SPLINE TO DRAW ROOF SHAPE AND FORM THE CURRECT CURVE USE DRAWING TABLET TO DO SO PLUS REFERENCE IMAGE

NOTE __ USE SWIFT LOOP AND TURBO SMOOTH TO MAKE THE ROOF CURVATURE IANS SUGGESTION
